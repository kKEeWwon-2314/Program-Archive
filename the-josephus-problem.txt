The problem is named after Flavius Josephus, a Jewish historian living in the 1st century. According to Josephus' account of the siege 
of Yodfat, he and his 40 soldiers were trapped in a cave by Roman soldiers. They chose suicide over capture, and settled on a serial 
method of committing suicide by drawing lots. Josephus states that by luck or possibly by the hand of God, he and another man remained 
until the end and surrendered to the Romans rather than killing themselves. This is the story given in Book 3, Chapter 8, part 7 of 
Josephus' The Jewish War.

However, in this extreme distress, he was not destitute of his usual sagacity; but trusting himself to the providence of God, he put his 
life into hazard [in the manner following]: "And now," said he, "since it is resolved among you that you will die, come on, let us commit 
our mutual deaths to determination by lot. He whom the lot falls to first, let him be killed by him that hath the second lot, and thus 
fortune shall make its progress through us all; nor shall any of us perish by his own right hand, for it would be unfair if, when the rest 
re gone, somebody should repent and save himself." This proposal appeared to them to be very just; and when he had prevailed with them to 
determine this matter by lots, he drew one of the lots for himself also. He who had the first lot laid his neck bare to him that had the 
next, as supposing that the general would die among them immediately; for they thought death, if Josephus might but die with them, was 
sweeter than life; yet was he with another left to the last, whether we must say it happened so by chance, or whether by the providence 
of God. And as he was very desirous neither to be condemned by the lot, nor, if he had been left to the last, to imbrue his right hand in 
the blood of his countrymen, he persuaded him to trust his fidelity to him, and to live as well as himself.

The details of the mechanism used in this feat are rather vague. According to James Dowdy and Michael Mays, in 1612 Claude Gaspard Bachet 
de MÃ©ziriac suggested the specific mechanism of arranging the men in a circle and counting by threes to determine the order of elimination.
This story has been often repeated and the specific details vary considerably from source to source. For instance, Israel Nathan Herstein 
and Irving Kaplansky (1974) have Josephus and 39 comrades stand in a circle with every seventh man eliminated.[5] A history of the problem 
can be found in S. L. Zabell's Letter to the editor of the Fibonacci Quarterly. Josephus had an accomplice; the problem was then to find the 
places of the two last remaining survivors (whose conspiracy would ensure their survival). It is alleged that he placed himself and the 
other man in the 31st and 16th place respectively, using some "cool" math and some bigbrain logic.

Solution:

Kill Counter = 2
We explicitly solve the problem when every second person will be killed, i.e. k = 2. We express the solution recursively.


When we tabulate the values of n and f(N) we see a pattern:

N   :	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10	11	12	13	14	15	16
f(N):	1	1	3	1	3	5	7	1	3	5	7	9	11	13	15	1
This suggests that f(N) is an increasing odd sequence that restarts with f(N)=1 whenever the index n is a power of 2. Therefore, if we 
choose m and l so that n=2^{m}+l and 0\leq l<2^{m}, then f(N)=2\cdot l+1. It is clear that values in the table satisfy this equation. 
Or we can think that after l people are dead there are only 2^{m} people and we go to the {@l+1th person. He must be the survivor. 
So f(N)=2l+1. Below, we give a proof by induction.

Theorem: 

If n=2^{m}+l and 0\leq l<2^{m}, then f(N)=2l+1.

Proof: 

We use strong induction on n. The base case n=1 is true. We consider separately the cases when n is even and when n is odd.
If n is even, then choose l_{1} and m_{1} such that n/2=2^{{m_{1}}}+l_{1} and 0\leq l_{1}<2^{{m_{1}}}. Note that l_{1}=l/2. 
We have f(N)=2f(n/2)-1=2((2l_{1})+1)-1=2l+1, where the second equality follows from the induction hypothesis. If n is odd, 
then choose l_{1} and m_{1} such that (n-1)/2=2^{{m_{1}}}+l_{1} and 0\leq l_{1}<2^{{m_{1}}}. Note that l_{1}=(l-1)/2. We 
have f(N)=2f((n-1)/2)+1=2((2l_{1})+1)+1=2l+1, where the second equality follows from the induction hypothesis. This completes the proof.

We can solve for l to get an explicit expression for f(N):
f(N)=2(n-2^{{\lfloor \log _{2}(n)\rfloor }})+1

The most elegant form of the answer involves the binary representation of size n: f(N) can be obtained by a one-bit left cyclic shift 
of n itself. If we represent n in binary as n=1b_{1}b_{2}b_{3}\dots b_{m}, then the solution is given by f(N)=b_{1}b_{2}b_{3}\dots b_{m}1. 
The proof of this follows from the representation of n as {\displaystyle 2^{m}+l}2^{m}+l or from the above expression for f(N).

Binary Implementation: 

If n denotes the number of people, the safe position is given by the function f(N)=2l+1 ,where n=2^{m}+l and 0\leq l<2^{m}.
Now if we represent the number in binary format, the first bit denotes 2^{m} and remaining bits will denote l. For example, 
when n=41, its binary representation is listed below.

n = 1 0 1 0 0 1

2m = 1 0 0 0 0 0

l = 0 1 0 0 1
