Mixing Milk
The Merry Milk Makers company buys milk from farmers, packages it into attractive 1 and 2 Unit bottles, and then
sells that milk to grocery stores so we can each start our day with delicious cereal and milk.

Since milk packaging is such a difficult business in which to make money, it is important to keep the costs as low
as possible. Help Merry Milk Makers purchase the farmers’ milk in the cheapest possible manner. The MMM company has
an extraordinarily talented marketing department and knows precisely how much milk they need each day to package for
their customers.

The company has contracts with several farmers from whom they may purchase milk, and each farmer has a (potentially)
different price at which they sell milk to the packing plant. Of course, a herd of cows can only produce so much milk
each day, so the farmers already know how much milk they will have available.

Each day, Merry Milk Makers can purchase an integer number of units of milk from each farmer, a number that is always
less than or equal to the farmer’s limit (and might be the entire production from that farmer, none of the production,
or any integer in between).

Calculate the minimum amount of money that Merry Milk Makers must spend to meet their daily need for milk.
NOTE: The total milk produced per day by the farmers will always be sufficient to meet the demands of the Merry Milk 
Makers even if the prices are high.
