Variables:

    N denotes the number of people in the initial circle
    K denotes the count for each step of execution
    The K-th person is executed
    K - 1 people are skipped

    NOTE: The people in the circle are numbered from 1 to n, not 0 to n

Operations in Python3:

    +	Addition	    x + y	
    -	Subtraction	    x - y	
    *	Multiplication	x * y	
    /	Division	    x / y	
    %	Modulus	        x % y	
    **	Exponentiation	x ** y	
    //	Floor division	x // y	

    NOTE: The Modulus operation is the remainder of division of one number by another
          For example, 15 % 7 = 15 - 7(15 // 7) = 1
          "//" is Floor division, which leaves the answer is the floor integer version of the decimal solution
          In conclusion, N % K is N - K(N // K)
